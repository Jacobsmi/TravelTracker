# TravelTracker

## Idea
- Have you ever been on social media or browsing the web and seen a beautiful photo or video of a place that you would love to travel to but, then realize that you have forgotten it the next day. That is what TravelTracker aims to fix by allowing you to remember these beautiful destinations and eventually travel there one day.

## How it works
- React Frontend
- Node Backend using Express and Typescript

## Setting up the server

- Prerequisits
  - Node.js
  - npm
  - SQLite3
- Step One
  - Install the npm dependencies by changing into the server directory and running `npm i`
- Step Two 
  - Create the database by running `node ./build/migrations/migrations.js`
- Step Three 
  - Run the server with `node ./build/index.js`
- All three commands can be run at once with `npm run dev`
